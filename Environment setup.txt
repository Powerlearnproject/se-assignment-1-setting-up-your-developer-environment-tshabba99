Challenges Faced 
When installing VS Code I found the initial configuration a little complex because I had to install plugins and packet managers like pip and I would make spelling mistakes and the computer would give me errors and this would frustrate me .


While installing the Version Control System I had a challenge with setting up my file path correctly. But after watching the video lesson again I was able to win.


I also experienced dependency conflicts and had to update certain packages.
